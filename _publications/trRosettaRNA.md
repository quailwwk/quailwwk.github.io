title: "trRosettaRNA: automated prediction of RNA 3D structure with transformer network"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/trRosettaRNA
excerpt: 'In this work, we developed trRosettaRNA, a deep learning-based RNA structure prediction method.In the blind tests of the 15th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP15) and the RNA-Puzzles experiments, the automated trRosettaRNA predictions for the natural RNAs are competitive with the top human predictions. trRosettaRNA also outperforms other deep learning-based methods in CASP15 when measured by the Z-score of the Root-Mean-Square Deviation.'

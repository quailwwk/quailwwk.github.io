<i>The accuracy of de novo protein structure prediction has been improved considerably in recent years, mostly due to the introduction of deep learning techniques. In this work, <b>trRosettaX, an improved version of trRosetta for protein structure prediction</b> is presented. The major improvement over trRosetta consists of two folds. The first is <b>the application of a new multi-scale network, i.e., Res2Net, for improved prediction of inter-residue geometries</b>, including distance and orientations. The second is <b>an attention-based module to exploit multiple homologous templates</b> to increase the accuracy further. Compared with trRosetta, <b>trRosettaX improves the contact precision by 6% and 8% on the free modeling targets of CASP13 and CASP14, respectively</b>. A preliminary version of trRosettaX is </b>ranked as one of the top server groups in CASP14's blind test</b>. Additional benchmark test on 161 targets from CAMEO (between Jun and Sep 2020) shows that <b>trRosettaX achieves an average TM-score ≈0.8, outperforming the top groups in CAMEO</b>. These data suggest the effectiveness of using the multi-scale network and the benefit of incorporating homologous templates into the network. </i>

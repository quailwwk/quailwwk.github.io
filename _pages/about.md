I'm a PhD student from [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Jianyi Yang](https://yanglab.qd.sdu.edu.cn/people/jianyi/). 

I'm working on improving the <b>protein/RNA structure prediction using deep learning techniques</b>.

I have currently developed a series of AI-based structure prediction algorithms, including:
  - [trRosettaX](https://quailwwk.github.io/publication/trRosettaX): a protein structure prediction algorithm using multi-scale network and homologous templates.
  - [trRosettaX-Single](https://quailwwk.github.io/publication/trRosettaX-Single): a single-sequence-based structure prediction algorithm which outperforms AlphaFold2 on orphan proteins.
  - [trRosettaRNA](https://quailwwk.github.io/publication/trRosettaRNA): an automated RNA structure prediction algorithm that is competitive with human expert-based prediction for natural RNAs.

You can find my CV here: [[EN]](/cv/) [[中文]](../assets/CV(chs).pdf).

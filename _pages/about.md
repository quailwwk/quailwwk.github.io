I'm a PhD student from [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/) and advised by [Prof. Jianyi Yang](https://yanglab.qd.sdu.edu.cn/) I'm working on improving the protein/RNA structure prediction using deep learning techniques.

You can find my CV here: [Wenkai Wang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
